# React Filter Recipes

ReactJS Track Challenge from [Codination](https://www.codenation.com.br), this app lists and filters recipes using ReactJS.

## Built with

- React
- ES6

### How it works

1. Dynamically renders the `RecipeItems` component for all elements within the sample data;

3. Case insensitive filter;
